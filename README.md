ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Anna-Lopatukhin!

I'm a final year Mechanical Engineering student with 2+ years of work experience.

I'm currently self-teaching myself software to make an entrance into the industry and expand my current knowledge base. I hope to create a sweet mashup between Mechanical Engineering + Software.

And while you're here, I guess you can checkout my GitHub too!
